2Welcome. What can I do for you?

1Golden Knight
2I want a magic potion to enhance my strength.
2Do you have any?

1Shopkeeper
2I do, indeed. But you cannot pay for it, for it is too valuable to be traded with gold.

1Golden Knight
2Then what do you want?

1Shopkeeper
2You must bring me a part of the golem residing in the ruin.
2Only then will I consider giving you this potion.

1Golden Knight
2Very well then.
