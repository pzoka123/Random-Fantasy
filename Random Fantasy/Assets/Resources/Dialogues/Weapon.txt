2What is this sword? It has a hole on it.

1Blacksmith
2I see you have keen eyes, adventurer. That is a special sword you are holding there.
2The hole on the sword is supposed to hold a power gem, which can be founnd in the head of the stone golem.
2Without the gem, it is just an ordinary metal sword.

2Where can I find that golem?

1Blacksmith
2Oh are you going after the gem?
2I heard rumors that the golem resides in the stone ruin right outside the town.
2If you actually manage to retrieve the gemstone, I will give you the sword for free.

1Adventurer
2I will be back soon.
