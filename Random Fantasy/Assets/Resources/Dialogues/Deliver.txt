2While you are here, may I ask you for a favor?

1Adventurer
2What do you need of me?

1Blacksmith
2As you may have known, we have an adventurer guild in our town.
2I have an important message that needs to be delivered to the guild master.
2However, he has not been in town for a while, and I am too busy with this shop to go look for him.
2Can you find out more information on his whereabout and deliver this message to him for me?
2As a reward, I will give you a special weapon when you finish the job.

1Adventurer
2Just leave it to me. I will make sure the guild master receives this message.
